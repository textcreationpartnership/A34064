            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BY the divine Mercy and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance I have now finiſhed my illuſtration of our Publick Offices (which end with theſe Forms of Ordination,) By ſhewing how
<pb facs="tcp:61516:3"/> agreeable theſe (as well as the reſt) are to Scripture, to pure Antiquity, and to the deſign of this important Duty; I have alſo compared this with the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals of other Churches, Ancient and Modern, and hope all impartial Judges will own, that ours receives great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by the compariſon: But my principal care hath been to help the Candidates for Holy Orders, not only to underſtand, but conſider the whole compaſs of their Duty, and to perſuade them to perform it ſtrictly and exactly: Being well aſſured that nothing will more effectually conduce to the Glory of God, the Honour and Eſtabliſhment of this Church, to the growth of ſaving Knowledge and Piety, and the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Hereſie, Schiſm and Vice, than a learned and devout, an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary and induſtrious Clergy: And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly 'tis great pity we ſhould not have the beſt of Men to officiate, ſince we are
<pb facs="tcp:61516:3"/> bleſt with the moſt excellent Forms for all Divine Adminiſtrations.</p>
            <p>'Tis not poſſible more care ſhould be taken of this, than is here, as far as Rules and Offices can go: But 'tis your Grace, and the College of Biſhops muſt give life to the Churches Orders, and to my Endeavours: Your Grace hath a Right to theſe Papers, becauſe you are the chief Governor in Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, under whoſe Hands moſt of the Right Reverend the Biſhops receive their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, with power to admit others to the inferior Orders. Wherefore from your Graces known zeal, and exemplary care, we cannot but expect ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ſhall every where be taken in this Affair; that none ſhall be received into this Holy Function, but ſuch as are like to be a laſting Honour to it; Our Adverſaries on both Hands ſeem now to deſpair of their baffled objections againſt our Forms, but fail not to enlarge on
<pb facs="tcp:61516:4"/> the popular Theme, of perſonal refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions upon ſome defaulters, ſo that if thoſe that are already Ordained and yet offend, were reformed, and the unqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified kept out for the future, our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies ill will would want matter to work on, and our <hi>Sion</hi> would be the Joy of the whole Chriſtian World. If both Clergy and People could be brought up to an adequate conformity to our incomparable Rules, it would immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately be apparent (what all theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes are intended to prove) that there is nothing material to be reformed in our Conſtitution<note n="(u)" place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:61516:4"/> our Lives be anſwerable to our moſt Holy Profeſſion, and our Practices agreeable to our Vows; Which I am confident will be ſincerely endeavoured by your Grace; and that Heaven may proſper you, and all our Governors in ſo juſt, ſo pious, and ſo laudable a deſign, ſhall ever be the ſubject of his Prayers, who deſires on this, and all occaſions, to approve himſelf,</p>

So that without a long Repentance, and ſuch a change of Heart and Manners as may ſecure them from relap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, I muſt adviſe theſe Perſons, not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to offer themſelves, for if the Biſhop do not, God (in whoſe place he ſtands) will puniſh this preſumption; And I know ſome Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious Perſons yet alive, who were otherways extraordinarily qualified for holy Orders, that meerly by reflecting on ſome of their too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon juvenile extravagancies, durſt not take the Miniſtry upon them, but applied themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves to Callings leſs grateful to them.</p>

                  <p>'Tis a juſt encouragement to our Prayers, when we know, that we deſire Gods bleſſing upon his own inſtitution and not our invention.

God in his Providence foreſaw in every Age what his Church would need. While Jeſus himſelf was on Earth only two Orders were neceſſary, the Apoſtles and LXX Diſciples, and thoſe he ordained; to theſe the Deacons were added by the direction of the holy Spirit: And while the Church was in planting, divers extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary degrees of Miniſters were requiſite for that difficult work; wherefore <hi>when our Lord aſcended up on high, he received of his Father and beſtowed on Men, ſeveral other ſpecial Gifts to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie ſome as Prophets to interpret the Scriptures of the old Teſtament by the ſame Spirit they were writ, others as Evangeliſts to write the Acts and Sermons of our Saviour, and Preach them and his Doctrine to ſuch Nations as had not heard of him</hi>

So neceſſary have all Churches thought the receiving of the Holy Communion to be, for ſuch as enter into Holy Orders: and it is upon ſeveral accounts very proper on that Occaſion. <hi>Firſt,</hi> As it gives them an opportunity to examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to repent of their Sins, for this will purifie their Souls before they enter upon a Sacred Office. 2ly. The worthy receiving this Holy Sacrament, will ſtir up in them a fervent Love to their Dear Redeemer, and an hearty Charity for thoſe he hath bought with his moſt Precious Blood; which two Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples will inſpire them with a great zeal for the glory of Chriſt, and the good of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Souls. 3ly. This Sacrament was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to convey to ſuch as are duly prepared for it, large meaſures of his Grace, and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:61516:125"/> they need a more than ordinary ſhare of it, to fit them for ſo Spiritual an Office. 4ly. The Lords Supper is a Federal Feaſt, wherein as our Lord ratifies his Covenant of Mercy and Grace to us, ſo do we ſeal our Vows and Promiſes of Duty and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him; and thoſe newly Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed have thoſe Engagements yet warm upon their Lips, which they have juſt now made to Jeſus by his Embaſſador: all which ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn promiſes of Services to be done in the Office they have undertaken in Chriſt's Family, they ratifie and confirm by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this Sacrament: Which of old was ſo uſually joyned to Oaths and Contracts, that the word <hi>Sacramentum</hi> ſignifies both <hi>an Oath and this Holy Myſtery.</hi> Thus Princes were wont to confirm their Leagues with each other; and receiving the Communion at their Coronation was as a Seal of their Oath then made to their People; and for this reaſon ſuch as are new Married are required to come to the Sacrament ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Matrimony, to bind themſelves more ſtrictly to keep their Conjugal Vows, as I have obſerved in a former Diſcourſe<note n="(n)" place="margin">

                  </head>
                  <p>The Office is cloſed with a Prayer (which is very proper for ſuch Acts as theſe, that are begun, continued and ended in God's Name) and with that Benediction which
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:61516:133"/> belongs to the Communion, that is always ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated at Ordinations: but theſe are both explained before in their proper places. So that I ſhall only obſerve the laſt Rubrick, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhes the Deacons to continue a whole year in this Order, and gives this reaſon for it, that they may be perfect and expert in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Adminiſtrations, before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Prieſts; which reaſon is ſo evident and convincing, that all Churches have founded ſuch a like Order upon it: for the Cuſtom hath every where been, to keep the Deacons for ſome time in that Office, before they go higher. Hence the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons here<note n="(b)" place="margin">Can. 32. Eccleſ.

But ſo as both they and we leave it to the Biſhops prudence, who upon reaſonable cauſes, that is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary merit of the Perſon, the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent profit of the Church, or ſome urgent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, may Ordain ſome Men ſooner. Though ordinarily it is much better to make them ſtay the year of probation in this firſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and ſometimes 'tis an argument of Mens pride and too much forwardneſs to offer themſelves ſooner. Beſides, this keeps up that Apoſtolical and Primitive Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the three Orders, which by no means ought to be broken or confounded; and perhaps it might not be amiſs if ſuch as are Ordained Deacons only to read, and do inferiour Offices in Cathedrals, or large Pariſhes, were always kept in that Degree, not only to make the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Orders more viſible, and to make ours more conformable to the Primitive Church; but to prevent that ſcandal, which ſome of theſe Men of ordinary Parts and mean Education, have frequently brought on the Venerable Order of Prieſthood. To conclude, the Office of a Deacon is by no means contemptible, but very honourable in it ſelf; and thoſe who are of this Order
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:61516:134"/> muſt endeavour ſo to live as to raiſe its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and then they may be very ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the Church, even in that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is a good ſtep towards an higher Degree, whereof I am next to treat.</p>

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:61516:137"/> It is ſufficient to my purpoſe to ſhew the honour of Prieſthood, which in the beſt Ages was thought worthy to act joyntly with Biſhops in moſt Eccleſiaſtical concerns, and to have the next degree of Reverence and Authority to them; yet ſtill ſo as to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior and ſubordinate to their Biſhop: And I look upon it to be equally pernicious to the Church, for Presbyters to aſpire to a parity with Biſhops, or for theſe to deſpiſe the others as unworthy to adviſe or aſſiſt them; For the former deſtroys, and the latter very much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs the good Government of the Church: The Biſhops cannot exerciſe that Authority which Chriſt and his Apoſtles left them, if Presbyters be their equals, this will make (as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſpeaks,) <hi>as many Schiſms as Prieſts:</hi> And they cannot have that uſeful aſſiſtance, toward the execution of their Epiſcopal Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which was deſigned them when they exclude ſo many learned and able Men, as this next Order affords, from their Counſels and and Adminiſtrations, wherefore the Orders muſt be diſtinct to avoid confuſion, but provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Subordination be kept up, due reſpect ſhould be ſhewn, to exclude Arbitrary Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And this temper is preſcribed by that often quoted Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which decrees, <hi>That the Biſhop ſhall ſit higher in the Aſſembly of Presbyters in the Church:</hi> But within the Houſe he ſhall conſider them as his Colleagues<note n="(c)" place="margin">Ut Epiſcopus in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiâ in confeſſu Presbytero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ſublimior ſedeat, intra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vero domum, collegam Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterorum ſe eſſe cognoſcat, <hi>Conc.

                     </note>. So that antiquity required
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:61516:138"/> of Presbyters, to expreſs all imaginable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence in publick to their Biſhop, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his Superiority, and of Biſhops to ſhew them in private all poſſible reſpect, and treat them with great Civility: And I could inſtance in ſome of our greateſt Biſhops of this and the laſt Age, who by calling ſome of the moſt learned, grave and experienced of their Clergy to conſult with in private, about their weightieſt Affairs, have done them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves great Service, and gained a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation from all, as well as a greater reſpect from their whole Clergy thereby: To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, Humility is the Duty, the Ornament and Security of both Orders, and that Grace alone will ſet all right on both ſides, and bring Glory to God and benefit to the Church.</p>

From hence it was, that ſoon after his Aſcenſion there was ſuch a plentiful effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Spirit, which manifeſted it ſelf in ſo great a variety of Gifts, that one man was fitted for the higher, another for the lower Miniſtries of the Church. For <hi>[he gave ſome]</hi> proper gifts to be <hi>[Apoſtles]</hi> and his Chief Repreſentatives in planting and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Church. He alſo gave <hi>[ſome]</hi> the gifts of expounding the Prophecies of the Old Teſtament, and of foretelling future events, whence they were called <hi>[Prophets,]</hi> whoſe principal work was to convince the Jews. Then for the converſion of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, he gave <hi>[ſome]</hi> the gifts of writing the Goſpel by inſpiration, and Preaching it to Infidels that never heard of it before, which were ſtiled <hi>[Evangeliſts.]</hi> Now theſe were Miniſters in extraordinary at the firſt planting of Chriſtianity: but for ordinary Miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that were to continue always in the Church, He gave <hi>[ſome]</hi> proper gifts to rule and preſide over the Believers of a larger Territory, who were Biſhops or <hi>[Paſtors, and]</hi> to others under them he gave ſuch gifts as fitted them to inſtruct the People in all holy Religion, who were called Doctors, or <hi>[Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers]</hi> and afterwards Prieſts.

                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 12. So that none ought to envy at any of theſe Perſons, whoſe gifts are not derived from themſelves, nor deſigned for their private
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:61516:141"/> honour or advantage, but are given to them, eſpecially to thoſe of the ordinary and durable Orders <hi>[For the perfecting of the Saints]</hi> in knowledge and practice of the higher My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries and Duties of Chriſtianity, which is the proper Office of Biſhops, <hi>[For the work of the Miniſtry]</hi> in Praying, Preaching and taking Care of the Poor, which is the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Prieſts and Deacons in particular; but then in general all of them have their Gifts and Offices given and appointed <hi>[For the edifying of]</hi> the whole Church, which is <hi>[the Body of Chriſt]</hi> and ought to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally improved in vertue and knowledge.</p>

                  <head>A Diſcourſe upon the Exhortation. §. 2.</head>
                  <p>This neceſſary, pious, and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive admonition is very properly introduced by putting the Candidates in mind, as well of that which was ſaid to them when they were privately examined, (for it ſuppoſes, that the Arch-deacons gave them a Charge then,) as of that which hath been juſt now read to them, out of the Goſpel and Epiſtle concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Dignity and Importance of this Office whereunto they are called: Yet leſt they ſhould forget the private inſtructions for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly given them, or not readily infer theſe things from the portions of Scripture now read, The Biſhop doth once more exhort them in the name of Jeſus Chriſt (his and their Great Maſter) to remember how High their Station, and how Weighty their Charge is. And firſt he declares the Dignity of their Office by thoſe various Titles given to thoſe inveſted with it in Holy Scripture, and then ſhews the various Duties which every one of theſe Names imports. The Titles are, <hi>Meſſengers, Watchmen and Stewards of the Lord:</hi> The Duties, <hi>as Meſſengers to teach, as Watchmen to forewarn or premoniſh, and as Stewards to feed and provide for the Lord's Family. Firſt,</hi> The Prophets (in the Old Teſtament) and the Prieſts are ſtiled <hi>the Meſſengers of the Lord of Hoſts</hi>

Now this
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:61516:152"/> is indeed a very honourable ſtation, but withal a very difficult one, to inſtruct and warn, preſide over, and feed all regular Chriſtians; to ſearch after and bring home all the irregular: this (as St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> expreſſes it) is a burden too great for an Angels ſhoulders, and they who undertake it may cry out in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words, <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 16.</p>
                  <p>And the weight of this Charge will ſtill be more apparent if it be further conſidered, of how great importance the affairs, and of how infinite value the things committed to their care are. 'Tis not the affairs of one earthly Kingdom, the ſafety of a fenced City, or the money and goods of one great Man; but the concern of the King of Kings, the ſecurity of Chriſts Church, and the Souls, the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Souls of Men, that are intruſted to their care.

For his and their peoples ſakes they ſhould manage it with their utmoſt skill and induſtry, for his Favour and their Peoples eternal Welfare or Miſery intirely depends upon it. But if this will not ſufficiently work upon them, the Biſhop char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them to be good Stewards <hi>for their own ſakes,</hi> becauſe, as Humane Maſters do ſtrictly call their Principal Servants to account, for all things under their charge, and make them anſwer or ſuffer for all that is loſt by their default: So theſe Spiritual Stewards may be well aſſured, that their Heavenly and All-ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lord (the Judge of all Men) will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reckon with them for all that he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted them with. So that if the Church in general, or any Member of it in particular be damnified by their Folly, Fraud, or Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence; as the Sin is great to be falſe or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in ſuch a Truſt, ſo the puniſhment ſhall be very great alſo. He hath often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that their Souls ſhall be condemned, and ſuffer for all thoſe poor Souls, that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and are loſt by their wilful neglect.

WHat has been ſaid on the Queſtions at the Ordination of a Deacon will ſuffice to be obſerved as to moſt of theſe, only where the Queſtions are altered, and appropriated to the Order of Prieſts; we will explain them here. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Queſtion doth materially differ, for a Deacons principal Duty being only to read the Scriptures, it was enough for him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare before God and the Congregation, <hi>that he believed all the Canonical Books were divinely inſpired:</hi> But a Prieſt muſt further, <hi>Firſt,</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his Faith, <hi>That the Holy Scripture contains all Doctrines that are neceſſary to be believed, and is ſufficient, through Faith, for our eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Secondly,</hi> He muſt publiſh his reſolution, to take all his Doctrines from thence, and promiſe never to teach any thing, as of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to Salvation, that cannot be proved thereby. For his Office is to preach all ſaving Truths, and teach his People all thoſe Duties that are requiſite to bring them to Eternal Life. Nor is there any need for the Candidate to heſitate at, or doubt of the Declaration or the Promiſe. For, 1ſt. The thing declared is certainly true, the Infallible Word of God doth aſſure him, <hi>that Holy Scripture is able</hi> (without the help of Tradition, or New Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations) <hi>to make us wiſe to Salvation through

<pb n="315" facs="tcp:61516:162"/> Diſcipline, ſo as the Lord hath commanded in his word, and ſo as the Eccleſiaſtical Laws of this Realm do appoint; which are not (bleſſed be God) two different ways here in this pure Church, becauſe we have declared, that we have no power to make any Laws in theſe matters contrary to God's word<note n="(m)" place="margin">Non licet Eccleſiae quicquam conſtituere quod verbo Dei ſcripto adverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Reformat.

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:61516:169"/> and Poets wherein excellent morality is to be found, and the choiceſt Criticks, who treat of Phraſes, Coins, Weights and Meaſures, with all thoſe Rites and Cuſtoms, which tend to illuſtrate the Holy Text: Nor ought he to be unacquainted with Hiſtory of all ſorts, and eſpecially the Hiſtory of thoſe Ages which are coincident with the times, and of thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, which are ſpoken of, in or adjacent to the places mentioned in Holy Scripture, to which Chronology and Geography will excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly conduce.

But what directly concerns him is, That which is properly called Theology, and ſo he muſt be well verſed in all Writers Syſtemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Textual, Hiſtorical, Polemical and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical. The Syſtematical, are the Catechiſts Ancient and Modern, and the Authors of whole Bodies of Divinity; The Textual are the learned and laborious Commentaries of the Holy Fathers, and later Orthodox Divines. The Hiſtorical are ſuch as have writ the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ſtory of the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Church in general, or the Lives of the Fathers, and moſt eminent Biſhops and Doctors, together with the Collectors of the Councils and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Laws of Chriſtian Princes. The Polemical are the ancient Apologiſts, and thoſe Orthodox Fathers who defended the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, againſt Paganiſm and old He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, as alſo ſuch as have maintained the Doctrine and Rites of the Reformed Church of <hi>England</hi> againſt Papiſts and Diſſenters:

                  <p>The Lutheran Forms after the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Anſwers, cited before, have a Prayer very like this in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance<note n="(t)" place="margin">Dominus igitur no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Jeſus Chriſtus, ſummus Paſtor &amp; Epiſcopus anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum noſtrarum, — vos in hac fide— &amp; in Chriſtiano propoſito clementer confirmet, &amp; conſervet. <hi>Form. Lipſ. An. 1624.</hi>
                     </note>. And this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pronounced by the Biſhop, who is Chriſt's immediate Officer, muſt be looked on as a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction, and not barely Petitionary: Though we ſee the Ordainer gives all the glory to God, aſcribing to him that good will which they have declared in freely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking theſe Duties, without whom we are not ſufficient ſo much as to think one good thought<note n="(u)" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5.</note>, much leſs to make ſo many holy Reſolutions. Now upon this ground, that the pious inclination and religious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:61516:174"/> came from God, the Biſhop proceeds rightly to beg of the Divine Author of their good will, <hi>to grant them ſtrength and power to perform all that they have promiſed,</hi> which is no more but <hi>the accompliſhing of that Work which he hath begun.</hi> They did own (in the firſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,) that God's Spirit (they believed) mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them to take on them this Sacred Calling, and he diſpoſed them freely to engage, that they will do all the Duties thereof. Now though reſolving to do well be the beginning, yet putting theſe Reſolves in execution, is the finiſhing of every good Work; and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance is the only perfection of a Promiſe. The Biſhop finds therefore God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and he hopes he will accompliſh this Work; yea, he may ſay with St. <hi>Paul</hi> to his Philippians, <hi>He makes this requeſt with joy,</hi> being confident of this very thing, <hi>that he who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun will certainly go on to perfect this good Work</hi>

                     </note>, <hi>They hope firmly that the ſame God will perfect in them, that which they rejoyce humbly to find he hath begun.</hi> And they cannot doubt of that which he hath not yet given them, without being ungrateful for what he hath already beſtowed on them. There is no reaſon why God gives the firſt Grace, that is purely gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous, but to infinite goodneſs, it is reaſon enough to give the ſecond grace, to ſecure his firſt bounty; for the good inclination and holy reſolution muſt diſſolve into air, without his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grace to enable us to purſue and perform them. So that all thoſe who freely make this Promiſe, need not be diſcouraged at the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and difficulty of their undertaking, but chearfully ariſe and be doing, being well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the Lord will be with them.</p>

<pb n="351" facs="tcp:61516:180"/> and teach our Prieſts, that they are not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to add any thing to perfect the work of Mans redemption, which Jeſus alone Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, nor are they now conſtituted to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice an Expiatory oblation to God, but to teach and convert Sinners among Men: Chriſt by his death hath reconciled God to them ſo far, that he is willing to pardon them upon their Repentance, and Miniſters are now to bring them to Repentance, and ſo reconcile God to them: This was the only deſign of our Saviour, when after his aſcenſion, He ſent abroad into the World Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Doctors and Paſtors, <hi>viz.</hi> To go and teach all Nations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to gather a great Flock in all parts of the Earth, who by their Devotions and Holy lives, might ſet forth the eternal praiſe of his Holy name: And thus we here commemorate the Author and the end of theſe Miniſterial Offices: But withal we remember alſo, the ſucceſs of theſe firſt Preachers, by whoſe Labours, out of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Jews and Gentiles, very many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Converts were made in a few years; yet the Collect notes, it was Chriſt who (by theſe holy inſtruments) did gather this great Flock together, for nothing leſs than a Divine power could work ſo great a Wonder; It had been impoſſible, without the miraculous aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Jeſus and his Spirit, that a few poor deſpicable. Men without human Learning, or any force, ſhould in ſo ſhort a ſpace have tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over the obſtinacy and malice of the Jews, who had crucified their Saviour; and over the power and inveterate prejudices of
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:61516:181"/> the Gentiles, who worſhipped Stocks and Stones, their fellow creatures in Heaven and Earth, yea Devils and evil Spirits: Yet innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable multitudes of theſe were brought over to believe Doctrines, far above the reach of human Reaſon, as well as contrary to all their former Notions, and perſuaded to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe Rules of ſtrict Holineſs directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to their old vicious habits and worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt: So that within an Age or two, The Apologiſt openly tells the Emperor, <hi>that though Chriſtianity was lately ſet up, it had already filled their Cities, Provinces, and all eminent places of the Empire, even the Palace, the Senate and Pleading places, leaving only the Temples for the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>

Now there are two Reaſons why we remember this here. Firſt, More remotely to encourage our new Paſtors to hope for the Divine aſſiſtance; ſince they are appointed by the ſame God to ſucceed in the ſame Employment. Secondly, To engage us to render moſt hearty thanks to
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:61516:181"/> the Lord for theſe great benefits flowing from his eternal goodneſs; that is, for ſending ſuch uſeful orders of Men into the World, to ſave ſo many millions of Souls, and for laying ſo ſtrong a foundation for his Church at firſt, that the ſaving knowledge of his Holy Goſpel hath continued throughout all Ages, and ſpred over all Nations, ſo that we whoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors ſat in the ſhadow of Death, we who live in the laſt of times, and a remote Angle of the World, have this ſaving light clearly ſhining among us: And here to heighten our gratitude, and tune our praiſes to the higheſt key, we alſo fitly remember this preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of God's goodneſs, in calling theſe that are now to be ordained, to that ſame Office and Miniſtry, which he firſt appointed for the Salvation of Mankind.

For we muſt diſtinguiſh this firſt Miſſion for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Office of Paſtors (which was always to continue in the Church) from that extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Miſſion and Miraculous giving of the Holy Ghoſt on the day of Pentecoſt, after his Aſcenſion.

<pb n="364" facs="tcp:61516:187"/> much of the Holy Ghoſt and his Gifts are now imparted to him, as are neceſſary for the diſcharge of that Office to which the Spirit hath called him, ſo much as will qualifie him to judge ſo rightly concerning remitting and retaining Sins, that God may ratifie his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in Heaven, forgiving thoſe he declares Penitent, and condemning ſuch as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces Impenitent; and this will make him careful in his managing of Sinners, and bring a great and deſerved veneration upon all his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Acts of Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, as well as incredible benefit to his Peoples Souls.</p>

                  <p>Nothing can be more proper to begin the Conſecration of a Biſhop, than the commemoration of thoſe Gifts which Chriſt gave, and that Charge he laid upon his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, the Firſt Biſhops of his Church; the ſame Charge being incumbent upon Biſhops now, which was given to the Apoſtles; and as they have their Duty, they need ſome meaſure of their Aſſiſtance. The Apoſtolical Office was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly temporary, while the Church was planting; but the Biſhops, by their appointment, were fixed to Feed and Rule it, after it was Setled, unto the end of the World. Hence they were in all Antiquity counted the Succeſſors of the Apoſtles, and the Fathers call the Apoſtles, Biſhops<note n="(o)" place="margin">Apoſtolos, i. e.

He gave to his Apoſtles many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Gifts indeed, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> enumerates, <hi>viz. The Word of Wiſdom and of Knowledge, the Gift of Faith, the Power of Healing and Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miracles, the Spirit of Prophecy, the Skill of Diſcerning Spirits, and of Speaking as well as Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting divers Tongues</hi>

Some of which were Miraculous, and peculiar to that Age, and therefore are now ceaſed; but thoſe of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Knowledge, and a ſound as well as a ſtrong Faith, are ſtill neceſſary, and therefore permanent. So that we may juſtly beg theſe Gifts for our Biſhops; ſo the Greek Church pray, <hi>That God would ſtrengthen their Biſhops with the Grace of his Bleſſed Spirit, as he ſtrengthned his holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi>

                        <hi>See Chap.</hi> viii. §. 1.</note>, and ſhew, that even in our days many pious Biſhops do preach ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often, both in their Cathedrals, and in Cures where there is but mean proviſion for this Office, whereby they both ſet a good Example to the inferior Clergy; and (ſince their Dignity gives great weight to their Exhortations and Reproofs) it is likely they may hereby promote the Salvation of many People: this Petition therefore that Biſhops may diligently preach God's Word, is ſtill very fit to be made. 'Tis true, <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of their Office, wherein the Prieſts are not joyned in Commiſſion with them, ſo that the main Burden thereof lies on their
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:61516:209"/> Shoulders; and the male adminiſtration of it muſt wholly lie at their Doors, which is, <hi>the due Exerciſe of Church Diſcipline,</hi> which may juſtly be ſtiled <hi>godly,</hi> both from the Original of it, being taken out of God's Word; and the End of it, which is to promote Virtue and Godlineſs. And this is a more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of the Biſhop's Office than Preaching, which he ſhould principally intend. There are ſome Cauſes too difficult, and ſome Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders too great or too obſtinate for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Clergy, and there the Biſhop muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe, by firſt Admoniſhing, and then Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring ſuch as notoriouſly offend in Faith or Manners; a good Paſtor muſt not only Feed the Sound, but Heal the Sick and Wounded Sheep; Seek them that are Loſt, Bring home ſuch as are gone Aſtray; Separate thoſe that may Infect others, and finally Caſt out them that are Incurable. Now to do this <hi>Duly,</hi> that is, as oft as there is occaſion, and by a right manner of proceeding, requires much skill and pains, and will take up much time, and need continual application; but the benefit and comfort ariſing from the faithful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of this difficult Province, will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly requite the labour of it here, yet it ſhall be rewarded eternally hereafter, when the great Shepherd ſhall appear. In the next place we alſo pray for the People, that the Biſhop's diligence and care may have a due effect upon them, even <hi>that they may obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently follow</hi> their Exhortations, and Advice from the Pulpit, and patiently ſubmit to their Monitions and Cenſures, while they exerciſe

                  <p>The providing and qualifying faithful Paſtors to be ſet over his Flock, is an illuſtrious inſtance of God's Mercy, and therefore we call upon him, by the title of <hi>moſt merciful Father:</hi> He knows and pities the wants of all his Servants, and thoſe in the higheſt ſtation having the moſt difficult Employment, need the greateſt aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; They may labour, but all in vain, unleſs God's <hi>Heavenly bleſſing crown them with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs (e),</hi> otherwiſe they may complain,<note n="(n)" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 6, 7.</note> with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> that they have toiled Night and Day and taken nothing<note n="(o)" place="margin">

<pb n="501" facs="tcp:61516:255"/> Spirit, which muſt be large in a Biſhop, who muſt be endued with ſo much Grace, and ſo many Gifts of the Spirit, as will enable him to Preach ſucceſsfully, to live exemplarily, and to perſevere even to fulfil his courſe. No or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Portion of God's Spirit will fit a Man for all this; and therefore we beg a large proportion of Gifts and Graces, becauſe this is an extraordinary occaſion. From theſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Petitions, we paſs to ſurvey the ſeveral parts of his Duty, as they are laid down in the Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy;</hi> who being made Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was, firſt as to his Preaching, charged to be inſtant or earneſt; that is, diligent and zealous<note n="(q)" place="margin">2 <hi>Timoth.</hi> iv. 2.

<pb n="502" facs="tcp:61516:256"/> which flow from having done them here, and the infinitely glorious and eternal rewards prepared for them hereafter; and all this, with ſuch moving Oratory and preſſing intreaties, that he may win his people to love God, and delight in that which is good: And when there is occaſion in private to admoniſh and <hi>rebuke an Offender;</hi> we pray he may do it without fury and paſſion, like a true Spiritual Father<note n="(s)" place="margin">
